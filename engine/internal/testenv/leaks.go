// The leak gate.
//
// A test that reaches the CLI's autostart path spawns "<this binary> serve
// --detach". The guards in internal/daemon and internal/daemon/client stop
// that spawn from happening at all, but a guard can be bypassed (a harness
// sets BERTH_ALLOW_TEST_DAEMON, a new code path forgets to consult it), and a
// leak is silent: the parent test passes and the stray process lives on. So
// every isolated package also *looks*, after its tests have run, and fails the
// run if anything is still there.
//
// What it may look at is bounded by ownership. The gate kills what it finds,
// so a rule that matched more than this run started would make one suite kill
// another's daemon and fail that run for a leak it did not cause — which is
// what "any oberth serve under the temp directory" did on a machine running
// several worktrees at once. Everything this run starts is under its own temp
// root (see testenv.Root), and that is the whole of the search space unless
// BERTH_TESTENV_GATE_ALL=1 says the machine belongs to one suite.

// Daemon is one stray process left behind by this test binary.
