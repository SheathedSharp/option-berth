// A Go test binary must never become a oberth daemon.
//
// `go test` links each package into an executable named <pkg>.test. Handing
// that executable the arguments `serve --detach` does not start a daemon: Go's
// flag package stops parsing at the first non-flag argument, so `serve` and
// `--detach` are ignored and the binary runs the whole test suite again, in
// the background, against whatever HOME it inherited. A test that reaches the
// autostart path therefore forks a copy of itself every time it runs, and any
// test in that copy which reaches the same path forks again — which is how one
// afternoon of `go test` left 2,150 `cmd.test serve --detach` processes behind
// and exhausted swap (step 1A.20).
//
// The guard lives here because both ends need it: the client that would spawn
// the daemon (internal/daemon/client.Autostart) and the `oberth serve` that
// would become one (internal/cmd).

// AllowTestDaemonEnv opts a test binary back in to acting as a daemon. It
// exists so the guard can be exercised, and so a future harness that genuinely
// wants a test binary as its daemon can say so out loud. Nothing in the tree
// sets it.
