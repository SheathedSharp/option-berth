// the child survives its parent and keeps holding the stdout pipe it
// inherited. Wait then blocks forever copying from a pipe nobody will close,
// which is how a failed assertion turned into a ten-minute CI timeout. The
// whole tree goes, and env.command's WaitDelay is the backstop for anything
