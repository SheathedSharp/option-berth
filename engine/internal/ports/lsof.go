// cwdsFromLsof turns one `lsof -a -p <pids> -d cwd -Fpn` run into pid -> cwd.
// The field output is a record per line, `p<pid>` introducing a process and
// `n<path>` its working directory:
//
//	p1234
//	n/Users/me/project
//	p5678
//	n/var/empty
//
// The error is honoured only when lsof printed nothing at all. lsof can exit
// non-zero when one pid it was asked about has gone away, which is routine
// when the caller is asking about
// every listener on the machine, and it still prints every record it did
// resolve. Dropping the whole batch on that error left *every* process without
// a cwd for that scan, and a process with no cwd has no git root, so its group
// and its display name silently fell back to something else for one tick and
// then changed back.
//
// It lives outside the darwin-only file so the parsing is tested everywhere,
// not only on the platform that runs lsof.
