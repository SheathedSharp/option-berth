// Identity derives the project and worktree a claim belongs to from a working
// directory, letting an explicit project or worktree win over what the
// directory says (spec 2 §4).
//
// It lives here rather than in the CLI because two callers ask the same
// question from two different working directories: `option-berth claim`, from the
// shell's cwd, and the `claim_port` MCP tool, from the directory the agent
// started the MCP server in. A key that differed between them would hand the
// same worktree two sets of ports, which is exactly what claims exist to
// prevent.
//
// A directory outside any git checkout claims under the directory's own name;
// a directory that is not a checkout and has no name at all claims under
// "option-berth", so a key is never empty.
